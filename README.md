# Churn-Modelling-Prediction
# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using a supervised machine learning approach. The dataset contains various details of the bank's customers, and the target variable is binary, indicating whether a customer has left the bank (churned) or continues to be a customer.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of several features that describe the characteristics of the bank's customers. The target variable is:
- **Churn**: A binary variable indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a classification model that accurately predicts whether a customer will churn based on their characteristics.

## Models Used
Several classification models were trained and evaluated on the dataset, including:
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

## Results
The models were evaluated using accuracy as the performance metric. The best model achieved an accuracy of **86.5%**.
